# Experiment-4
## Write the test cases for any known application. (e.g. Banking Application)
# Aim: To detect fraudulent activities based on past spending patterns using machine learning

# Algorithm
1.	Collect data on user transactions (time, amount, location, merchant, etc.).
2.	Use a classification algorithm like Random Forest or Neural Networks to predict if a transaction is fraudulent.
3.	Based on the prediction, flag the transaction as suspicious if the probability exceeds a threshold.
4.	Notify the user if a suspicious activity is detected.
